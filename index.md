An enthusiastic and humble fast-learner with an international academic background. The desire to solve problems prompts me to investigate deeper scientific problems. Possessing prior knowledge on the science of environment and geology, I’m applying for the PhD candidate.

## EDUCATION
### Master of Science in Environmental Management

## ACADEMIC BACKGROUND
### Research Assistant
Shandong University (SDU)

_2019.01-Present Qingdao_

My research direction is the nitrogen-containing organic matters (e.g., nitrated phenols) in the ambient aerosol, including the sources, size-distribution, and secondary formation process. During my research in SDU, I fulfilled my research highly-independently throughout the process of sampling, measurement, data analysis, and drafting under the supervision of my supervisor. To understand the chemical and size-resolved characteristics and further the secondary formation processes of nitrated phenols in a coastal area in North China, we conducted a field observation in early 2019 in Qingdao. Currently, my research result has been published on _Chemosphere_. Besides, I supervised undergraduate students on their graduation projects.
